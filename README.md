To understand what relationship types are possible and map unstructured natural language descriptions onto these structured classes, we used labeled sentences in [Percha B 2018](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/15/2614/4911883) to classify relations bewteen chemicals, genes and diseases.
